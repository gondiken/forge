    "info": "About us:\n\nThe pension specialist\nZwitserleven is the only insurer in the Netherlands that focuses on pensions. No car, home contents or health insurance. So no distractions. And that makes us, as the only real pension brand, a specialist.\n\nWe offer everyone a pension in understandable language, with a clear overview. So that you know where you stand. And your survivors too. We want to give pensioners the Zwitserleven feeling, and that everyone around them can enjoy it.\n\nMission:\nThe Swiss life feeling.\nA feeling we share\n\nA new feeling\nYou know us from the Zwitserleven feeling. That is the feeling you have when you have arranged your pension well, so that you can enjoy your old age without worries. The Zwitserleven feeling is even in the Dikke Van Dale. We have become famous with it. Almost everyone knows it. \n\nWe therefore believe that everyone deserves the Zwitserleven feeling. High earners and low earners. Pensioners and toddlers. Cat people and dog people. And also yourself with the people around you.\n\nA feeling we share\nThere comes a day when you stop working. Then you retire. And then? You prefer to share that time with the people around you. Doing fun things together. With friends or family. Doing something useful in the neighborhood or at a club.\n\nAnd that is the beauty of the Zwitserleven feeling: it is contagious. You don't just enjoy it yourself. Others feel it too."
